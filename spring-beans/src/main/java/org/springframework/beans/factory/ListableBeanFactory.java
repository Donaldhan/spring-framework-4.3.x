/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *ListableBeanFactory扩展了bean工厂接口，ListableBeanFactory接口的实现可以列举所有bean实例，
 *而不是作为一个请求客户端尝试以bean的名称，搜索bean。BeanFactory实现将会预先加载所有配置中BeanFactory
 *的所有bean定义。
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *如果bean工厂是一个可继承的bean工厂HierarchicalBeanFactory，返回值将不会考虑父类工厂bean，
 *仅仅考虑与当前bean工厂关联的bean。BeanFactoryUtils工具类获取的祖先bean工厂，将考虑在内。
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *接口方法，只会搜索当前bean工厂的bean定义。将会忽略所有通过ConfigurableBeanFactory的registerSingleton方法，
 *注册到bean工厂的单例模式bean。
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 *注意：getBeanDefinitionCount和containsBeanDefinition方法异常情况，此方法不是设计为频繁调用的。
